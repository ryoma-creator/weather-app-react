                    ✔️	  1. First React component 
						  	- (!) try to make props to pass them to img (I could not do right away)
							- (!) props ⇨ need same duplicate props 
							- ⇨ to avoid it, you need "array from" method (I wasnt seen yet)
                    ✔️	  2. Creating multi-component files 
                    ✔️	  3. Adding markup with JSX {profile}
                    ✔️	  4. Using JavaScript in JSX
						  	-(!) name {key1:値 , key2:{key:値,key:値}} ⇨  name.key2 ⇨ {key:値,key:値} !
							- css style ⇨ object better ?
                  	✔️     5. Passing props to a component 
                            - (!)Understanding Data Flow in React:
                            As long as Parent data, you can pass Props down to other every children.
                    ✔️	  6. Conditional rendering of components {basic To do List}
						  	- (!) Attempt to make extra condition for basic to do (understand more what I need)
                    ✔️	  7. Rendering multiple components {e-commerce item website etc..}
    
                         8. Writing pure components
                    ✔️    9. Understanding UI as a tree

						All Data list , object should be added by useState before you use.
						⭐️	- (!)useState(List[index]) → map→ change  each index → template pattern
						- Memory become heavy ⇨ not effective

Jul 1 						 Restart "CV App" development
							 - Review and Analyze and understanding

Jul 2 						 - Visualize CV App and another COLORS App flow by Figjam 
							   to analyze and understanding WHY (while visualizing)

								1. **props vs import/export**
								- Passing data from parent to child through props is similar to export and import.
								- Export/import removes file boundaries, making components feel like they are in the same file.

								2. **Dynamic switching method**
								- Question on how to use `useState` to change data when wrapping data in an Object instead of a List.

								3. **Differences between List and Object**
								- List: An image of moving index numbers (moving the current state with index + 1).
								- Object: Managing data with keys (clarification needed).

								4. **Placement of useState and onClick buttons**
								- Interested in the compact color change method of OdinProject.
								- Consultation on whether to use conditional rendering.

								5. **File splitting of components**
								- Question on how far to split components into files.

								6. **Placement of event handlers**
								- Ranking of the most commonly used approaches.

								7. **Handling data written in Object instead of List**
								- Question on how to handle data when `map` cannot be used with Object.

								8. **Handling Objects**
								- Question about the management methods of Objects.

								9. **Data linking between files**
								- Method to change data between `Category.js` and `ProfileForm.js`.
								- How to cross file boundaries using export/import.

								10. **Behavior of click events**
									- Method to correspond to the array index with a click event.
									- Managing multiple lists titled with object keys (e.g., profile, education).

								11. **Linking stateholder and list in separate files**
									- Method to link the data of `Category` and `Input` respectively.

								12. **Considering component and file structure using FigJam**
									- Creating flowcharts and diagrams with FigJam to visualize component structure and data flow.
									- Planning component interactions and partitioning methods.

								13. **Dividing Odin Project's Colors mini-app into components**
									- Considering the method of dividing the Colors mini-app into components.
									- Identifying the optimal partitioning method and integrating it as a dynamic function into the CV app.
									- Advancing considerations while creating flowcharts with FigJam.

			[Progress summary July 12]
			**Implementation of Basic React Component Structure**

				- Created the basic structure for `App.js`, `CategoryList.js`, `ProfileForm.js`, and `InputFields.js`.

				**Introduction of State Management**

				- Used the `useState` hook to manage the state of category selection.

				**Basic Implementation of Data Flow**

				- Passed data between components using props.

				**Application of CSS Styling**

				- Implemented responsive design using Flexbox and media queries.

				**Implementation of Basic Form Input Structure**

				- Implemented various input types (text, number, file).


				These advancements have led to the implementation of the basic structure and functionality of the application. However, features such as data storage and editing, as well as the final resume display, have not yet been implemented.



						[Details what did I do]
						### Development of a Resume Application

						#### Understanding the Component-Based Structure with React
						- Trying to understand the roles of `App.js`, `CategoryList.js`, `ProfileForm.js`, and `InputFields.js`.

						#### State Management and Data Flow
						- Learning how to use the `useState` hook.
						- Trying to understand how to pass data through props.
						- Implementing state management for category selection.

						#### CSS Styling
						- Learning how to use Flexbox.
						- Implementing responsive design with media queries.
						- Trying to understand the usage and meaning of the `calc()` function.

						#### Improving Form Inputs
						- Considering the selection of appropriate `input` types.
						- Learning how to add the `pattern` attribute.
						- Trying to understand the implementation of file input (profile image).

						#### Data Structure
						- Trying to understand the structure and usage of `categoriesData` and `sectionData`.

						#### Unimplemented Features (Understanding and Planning Phase)
						- Adding a practical experience section.
						- Implementing edit and submit functions.
						- Implementing data display after submission.
						- Using the input mask library (`react-input-mask`).
						- Introducing React DatePicker.
						- Persisting data using local storage.

						#### Areas with Insufficient Understanding
						- Usage of `Array.from()` and `map()`.
						- Appropriate usage and management of the `useState` hook.
						- Meaning and usage of the `accept` attribute.
						- Role and implementation of the `onSave` function.

						#### Considerations
						- Whether to integrate a backend using SQL.
						- Appropriate usage of libraries.
						- Visually improving the application with background videos.

						#### Questions
						- Specific implementation methods for data saving and editing features.
						- Implementation methods for the final resume display feature.
						- Designing reusable components and practicing repetitive implementation.

						#### Learning Direction
						- Need to deepen understanding of basic React concepts and state management.
						- Learning detailed control methods in CSS.
						- Studying best practices for form processing and data management.
